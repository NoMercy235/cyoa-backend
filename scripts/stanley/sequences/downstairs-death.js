        content: `But Stanley just couldn't do it. He considered the possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours. He might be fired for that. And in such a competitive economy, why had he taken that risk? All because he had believed everyone had vanished? His boss would think he was crazy.

And then something occurred to Stanley.

"Maybe," He thought to himself. "Maybe, I am crazy. All of my co-workers blinking mysteriously out of existence in a single moment, for no reason at all?" None of it made any logical sense.

Stanley began to pace further into the room, pondering how all this could be possible.`,

        content: `As he pondered this, he began to make other strange observations. For example; why couldn't he see his feet when he looked down? Why did doors close automatically behind where ever he went? And for that matter, these rooms were starting to look pretty familiar. Were they simply repeating? "No," Stanley thought to himself. "This is all too strange, this can't be real..."

And at last, he came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue. He just hadn't found the words for it.

"I'M DREAMING!" He yelled. "This is all a dream!". Ah, what a relief Stanley felt to have finally found an answer; an explanation. His co-workers weren't actually gone, he wasn't going to lose his job, he wasn't crazy after all. And he thought to himself, "I'll suppose I'll wake up soon. I'll have to go back to my boring real life job pushing buttons, I may as well enjoy this while I'm still lucid.`,

        content: `Stanley imagined himself flying, and began to gently float above the ground. Then he imagined himself soaring through space on a magical star field, and it too, appeared. It was so much fun! And Stanley marveled that he still hadn't woken up. How was he remaining so lucid? And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head, one he was amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner:

Why is there a page of text, dictating everything I'm doing and thinking? Now the text was describing itself being considered by Stanley, who found it particularly strange. "I'm dreaming about a text, describing me thinking about how it's describing my thoughts." He thought. And while he thought it all very odd, and wondered if this text appeared to all people in their dreams, the truth was, this was not a dream. How could it be? Was Stanley simply deceiving himself? Believing that if he's asleep, that he doesn't have to take responsibility for himself? 

Stanley is as awake right now as he's ever been in his life. Now seeing the text printing these words was quite a shock to Stanley. After all, he knew for certain, without a doubt, that this was, in fact, a dream. Did the text not see him float and make the magical stars just a moment ago? How else would the text explain all that? This text was a part of himself too! Surely, surely, if he could... 

He would prove it. He would prove that he was in control. That this was a dream. So he closed his eyes gently, and he invited himself to wake up.`,

"Let me wake up." He thought to himself. "I'm through with this dream. I wish it to be over. Let me go back to my job. Let me continue pushing the buttons. Please, it's all I want. I want my apartment. And my wife. And my job. All I want is my life, exactly how it's always been. My life is normal. I am normal. Everything will be fine.

I. Am. Okay...`,

Nothing had changed. He began screaming.

"Please! Someone wake me up, my name is Stanley! I have a boss, I have an office! I am real, please someone just tell me I am real! I must be real, I must be! Can anyone hear my voice?! WHO AM I?! WHO AM I?!?!?!?!"

Stanley collapsed on the ground, and everything went black.`,

        content: `This is the story of a woman named Mariella

Mariella woke up on a day like any other. She arose, got dressed, gathered her belongings, and walked to her place of work. But on this particular day, her walk was interrupted by the body of a man who was wandering through town, talking and screaming to himself, and collapsed dead on the sidewalk. And although she would soon turn and call for an ambulance, for a few brief moments, she considered the strange man. He was obviously crazy, this much she knew. Everyone knows what crazy people look like. And in that moment, she thought to herself how lucky she was to be normal. 

"I am sane." she thought. "I am in control of my mind. I know what is real, and what isn't." It was comforting to think this, and in a certain way, seeing this man made her feel better. But then she remembered the meeting she had scheduled for that day; the very important people, who's impressions of her would affect her career, and by extension: the rest of her life. She had no time for this, so it was only a moment she stood there, staring down at the body.

And then she turned and ran.`,
