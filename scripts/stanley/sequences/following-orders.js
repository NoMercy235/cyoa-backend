Apart from Stanley, there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he'd find an answer there. As he exited the meeting room, he entered another hallway. On his left was a door titled BROOM CLOSET.`,

What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from him, and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number:`,

As it descended deeper and deeper into the building, Stanley realised he felt a bit peculiar. It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself; to question the nature of his job. Why did he feel this now, when for years, it had never occurred to him? This question would not go unanswered for long.

The elevator came to a shuddering halt and the rusty door wrenched open. Stanley walked straight ahead to the large door that read 'Mind Control Facility'. There was also a long hallway on the left labeled crudely with a marker. The sign read 'Escape', but Stanley took no notice.`,

He pushed the button, and lights flicked on to reveal an enormous packed with television screens. "What horrible secret does this place hold?" Stanley thought to himself, but did he have the strength to find out?

A catwalk rose out of the ground and connected the current platform with another one in the distance.`,

Now the monitors jumped to life; their true nature revealed. Each bore the number of an employee in the building, Stanley's co-workers. The lives of so many individuals reduced to images on a screen, and Stanley, one of them, eternally monitored in this place, where freedom meant nothing.

A catwalk rose out of the ground and connected the current platform with another one in the distance.`,

        content: `A third button with an elevator insignia waited for Stanley to arrive. Once he pushed it, an elevator gently descended from the ceiling, with red lights blaring.

This mind control facility... it was too hard to believe; it couldn't be true. Had Stanley really been under someone's control all this time? Was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job? That his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly?

The elevator came to a screeching halt, and the gates slid open, waiting for Stanley to enter.`,

No! He refused to believe it. He couldn't accept it; his own life in someone else's control? Never! it was unthinkable, wasn't it? Was it even possible? Had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind to the world?

The elevator shook slightly and stopped in a room above the facility.

But here was the proof. The heart of the operation, computers, buttons and controls labeled with emotions; 'happy' or 'sad' or 'content'. Walking, eating, working... All of it monitored and commanded from this very place. And as the cold reality of his past began to sink in, Stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible power over another human life. For he, would dismantle the controls once and for all.

Stanley walked onto the catwalk that lead to a monstrously large screen that read 'Mind Controls Idle, Awaiting Input...'`,

Blackness. A rising chill of uncertainty. Was it over?

The immense door in front of him slowly opens as a thin, endless ray of light fills the giant room.

Yes! He had won! He had defeated the machine! Unshackled himself from someone else's command! Freedom was mere moments away! And yet, even as the immense door slowly opened, Stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay unsolved: Where had his co-workers gone? How had he been freed from the machine's grasp? What other mysteries did this strange building hold?

But as sunlight streamed into the chamber, he realised, none of this mattered to him, for it was not knowledge or even power that he had been seeking, but happiness. Perhaps his goal had not been to understand, but to let go. No longer will anyone tell him where to go, what to do, or how to feel. Whatever life he lives, it will be his, and that was all he needed to know. It was perhaps, the only thing worth knowing.

Stanley stepped through the opened door.`,
