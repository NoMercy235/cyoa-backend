You got to this broom closet, explored it a bit, and were just about to leave because there's nothing here, when a physical melody of some sort, shut down your central nervous system, and you collapsed on the keyboard. Well, in a situation like this, the responsible thing is to alert someone nearby, so as to ensure that your body is taken care of before it begins to decompose.

Hello? Anyone who happens to be reading this, the person at this computer is dead. He or she has fallen prey to any number of your countless human physiological vulnerabilities!
