As the machine sparked and whirred into motion, and Stanley was inched closer and closer to a giant crushing machine before him, he reflected that his life had been of no consequence whatsoever. Stanley can't see the bigger picture, he doesn't know the real story, trapped forever in his narrow vision, of what this thing is.

Perhaps his death was of no great loss, like plucking the eyeballs from a blind man. So he resigned, and willingly accepted this violent end to his brief and shallow life.

Farewell, Stanley.`,

When every path you can walk is made for you long in advance, death becomes meaningless, making life the same. Do you see... do you see that Stanley was already dead, the moment he hit start?`,

Can you see... Can you see how much they need one another? No, perhaps not. Sometimes these things cannot be seen.

Stanley ended up back inside the harness, ready to be crushed into oblivion.

But listen to me, you can still save these two. You can stop the program before they both fail! Click the text below and quit! There's no other way to beat this game! As long as you move forward, you'd be walking someone else's path! Stopping now is your only true choice! Whatever you choose, choose it! Don't let time choose for you! Don't let time-`,

A catwalk rose out of the ground and connected the current platform with another one in the distance.`,
