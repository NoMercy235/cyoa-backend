        content: `As he stepped out of his cubicle, Stanley was dumbfounded to find his day-to-day office, usually packed with his busy co-workers, was completely empty. No one was clacking at their keyboards, staring at screens, drinking their mugs of coffee, nothing.

Stanley slowly stepped through the office, gentle noises of his shoes against the murky-yellow carpeted floor. Not a whisper or word anywhere. He looked into the windows of the other cubicles, but no workers in sight. Even the tall, green pot plant outside Room 420 was beginning to die, and Employee 420 always watered it every morning. Quiet humming and beeps came from the clean, white tables. A quick glance proved even the computers were still on. The two large windows on the opposite wall were filled with blinding white light, and Stanley was never sure even when they were this bright before.

He took one last, desperate look around, but nothing...

Stanley was alone. What could it have meant? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room, perhaps he had simply missed an urgent memo.`,
