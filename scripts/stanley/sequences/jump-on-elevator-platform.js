Look, Stanley, I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here. I'm not your enemy, really I'm not! I understand that investing your trust in someone else can be difficult, but the fact is the Story has been about nothing but you, all this time!

There's someone you've been neglecting, Stanley; someone you've forgotten about. Please, stop trying to make every decision by yourself. Now, I'm not asking for me...

Don't you see that it's killing us, Stanley? I just... I want it to stop. I would... we would both be so much happier if we just... stopped.

Here!

Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? If we just stay right here; right in this moment with this place, Stanley, I think I feel... Happy. I actually feel happy! Heh!

Well, don't let me stop you.

Stanley walked into a tremendously large room with developer textures and broken rooms.

You see? There's nothing here. I haven't even finished building this section of the map because you were never supposed to be here in the first place! Broken rooms, exposed developer textures. Is this what you wanted? Was it worth ruining the entire Story I had written out specifically for you?

Do you not think I put a lot of time into that? Because I did. And in the end it was all for nothing, because this is what you wanted to see. Help me here, Stanley. Help elucidate these strange and unknown desires of yours. What would have made this game better? What did you want to see? Vehicles? Skill trees? Work with me, Stanley, you've given me absolutely nothing so far.

Tell you what; let me take a stab in the dark at a new design and you can give me some feedback.`,

Now, In this game, the baby on the right crawls towards danger on the left. You press the button in front of you to move him back to the right, and if he reaches the fire; you fail. It's a very meaningful game. All about the desperation and tedium of endlessly confronting the demands of family life. I think the art world will really take notice. 

But of course, the message of the game only becomes clear once you've been playing it for about four hours. So, why don't you give it four hours of play, to make sure it's effective. Be sure to take notes on your experience.

Before this moment I was blind, but these days are behind us. I now understand the true manifestation of this game.

It needs... A puppy!

A panel behind the baby slid open to reveal a puppy in a bucket hung up on a rope, lowering into a tank of puppy-eating piranha. Along with a new blue button on Stanley's right. 

That's right, this puppy is being lowered toward an aquarium filled with nothing but piranha! Now, you have to click the second button to avert the puppy's death in addition to the baby's!

This is it, Stanley! Art! I did it! Video games are art! Ah, but you have a good two hours or so to go, so I'll just let you get to that. No time to waste when there is such a meaningful game to be played! Bonne chance, mon ami!`,
